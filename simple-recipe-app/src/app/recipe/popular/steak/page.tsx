Steak and veggies make for a satisfying, protein-packed meal that's quick and easy to prepare. Start by seasoning your steak (ribeye, sirloin, or your favorite cut) with salt, pepper, and a sprinkle of garlic powder. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, adding a tablespoon of olive oil. Once the oil is hot, sear the steak for 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or adjust the cooking time to your desired doneness. Remove the steak and let it rest.

In the same skillet, add sliced vegetables like bell peppers, zucchini, and cherry tomatoes. Saut√© for 5-7 minutes until tender-crisp, adding salt and pepper to taste. For extra flavor, toss in some minced garlic or a splash of balsamic vinegar. Serve the juicy steak alongside the vibrant veggies, and enjoy a wholesome, delicious dinner that's ready in under 30 minutes.
